# ðŸ¤– WhimsiBot, the Discord Bot

A silly Discord bot that provides fun commands, especially made to help pass time while in quarantine due to COVID-19. *Necessity is the mother of all invention*, as they say.

This is my first time

* making a Discord Bot, using API calls,
* working with secret tokens and securing them using config variables,
* using an API Wrapper,
* deploying a project to Heroku,
* connecting Heroku to GitHub,
* and taking steps away from GitHub GUI/IDE GUIs for git into the world of command line!

Hope you enjoy.
